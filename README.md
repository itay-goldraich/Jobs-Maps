## Introduction

Have you ever thought about visualizing job listings on a map? The inspiration behind Jobs-Maps came from [this LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7092811087938514944/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android), discussing the potential of using a map for job searching. We've taken this concept and combined it with powerful data scraping techniques to create a unique job search experience.

## Features

### Geographical Visualization

Explore job listings with spatial context. Our map interface allows you to see where job opportunities are located, making it easier to identify positions near preferred locations.

### Search and Filter

Refine your job search with advanced filtering. Search for specific job titles, industries, or keywords, and filter results based on location, job type, and more.

### Data Scraper

We've implemented a Python-based web scraper to collect job data from LinkedIn. Leveraging the [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) framework, our scraper ensures that you have access to the most up-to-date job listings.
